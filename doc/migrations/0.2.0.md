# Migration from 0.1.x to 0.2.x

If you used this client before `0.2.0`, you have a different directory structure than the current one. If you want to upgrade, but keep all your data, here's a migration guide.

```bash
# Start in ./data
cd data

# Move your account key to new location:

mkdir accounts
mv account/key.pem accounts/acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org.directory.pem
# or accounts/acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org.directory.pem if it's a staging key

# account should now be empty or contain just a config.json, you can delete the folder then
rm -rf account

# Migrate certificates to new location:

cd certs
mkdir acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org.directory

# Move all your certificate directories
# Repeat for all directories!
mv example.com acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org.directory
# or acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org.directory

# Delete all config.json files which may exist
find -name "config.json" | xargs rm

# Update to current version
# Alternatively have a look at the new installation instructions and use the Phar
git checkout master && git pull

# Check out latest release
git checkout $(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)

# Update dependencies
composer update --no-dev

# Reconfigure your webserver to use the new paths
# and check (and fix) your automation commands.
```
